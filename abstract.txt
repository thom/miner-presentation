Presentation Abstract: Mining software repositories for intelligent
software maintenance

The aim of this presentation is to demonstrate the efficacy of
software repository mining in improving software maintenance,
specifically preventive maintenance. The first part of the talk will
introduce the topic of software version mining and discuss its
application in addressing a number of maintenance challenges such as
debugging, impact analysis, predicting faults, understanding software
evolution and so on. The second part of the talk will dwell on the
software repository mining framework that we have built. We wil show
the novelty in our approach and how it can help improve software
maintainability. The discussion is illustrated with a variety of real
examples.
